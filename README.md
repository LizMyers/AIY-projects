# AIY Projects
This repo supports 3 tutorials on Hackster.io that extend the AIY Voice Kit by Google. More specifically, these experiments are about adding a PiCamera to the Voice Kit (v1) and learning to use Google Cloud Services. This allows your Raspberry Pi to describe what it "sees".  

#### 01 <a href="https://www.hackster.io/elizmyers/aiy-smart-doorbell-02d8ad"> Smart Doorbell</a>
This tutorial is based upon <a href="http://blog.mybigideas.uk/2018/03/adding-vision-to-your-aiy-project-in-4.html"><i>Adding Vision to the AIY Voice Kit</i></a>, by Leo White. It's been updated in Python 3 to work with the latest <a href="https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/releases/tag/v20181116">AIY Kits Release (Nov 2018)</a>.

#### 02 <a href="https://www.hackster.io/elizmyers/add-vision-to-the-aiy-voice-kit-e9ff3d">What is That? Whose logo is that? What does that say?</a>
This tutorial makes further use of the PiCamera we added in the previous tutorial. It describes images it "sees" and demonstrates an enhanced Voice UI in Python. By including things like a personalized greeting, random hello/goodbye messages, better error handling, and a few sound effects - it provides a better quality experience. 

#### 03 Coming Soon!
Adding a Neopixel Ring to the AIY Voice Kit - for visual feedback via light arrays - just like a Google Home device.
