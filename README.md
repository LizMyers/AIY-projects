# AIY-projects
This repo supports 3 tutorials on Hackster.io that extend the AIY Voice Kit by Google. More specifically, these experiments are about adding a camera to the Voice Kit (v1). This allows the pi to describe what it "sees". It also provides a fun introduction to the Vision API on Google Cloud.
